Just started my internship with  hngi8 (Hotels Nigeria internship version 8 ), it’s a 8 weeks program and I plan to achieve  a lot during the course of this internship. I came across this internship on Twitter during one of my exploration journey of sourcing for tech related courses to enroll with, glad I joined, it’s looking promising.
My stack is Frontend Development, hope to get to an advanced level of Frontend development before the end of this program and I hope to be one of the few ones that make it to the finals.
